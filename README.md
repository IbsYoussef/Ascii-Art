This project is a command-line tool written in Go that takes user input and transforms it into styled ASCII art using various banner template styles like `standard`, `shadow`, and `thinkertoy`.

It was created as part of my coding course at 01 Founders to deepen my understanding of Go, file parsing, and modular programming — all while keeping things fun and creative. The tool handles multi-line input, clean formatting, and is structured for easy extension and maintenance.

## ✨ Features
- 🖊️ Takes user input from the command line and renders it as ASCII art  
- 🎨 Supports multiple banner styles (`standard`, `shadow`, `thinkertoy`)  
- 📜 Handles multi-line input using `\n` escape characters  
- 💡 Clean and modular Go codebase for easy readability and testing  
- 🧩 Embeds banner files into the binary for portability  
- ⚙️ Cross-platform builder with auto `.zip` packaging support  
---

## 🚀 Usage Instructions
- ### 📦 Clone the repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://learn.01founders.co/git/iyoussef/Ascii-Art.git
cd ascii-art
```

- ### ⚙️ Run the CLI (Go Users)
```bash
go run ./cmd "Hello World" <banner-choice>
```
You can use either `standard`, `shadow` or `thinkertoy` as you banner choice for the styling, if omitted the standard banner will be used by default.

To print text on multiple lines use \n in your string input:
```bash
go run ./cmd "Hello\nWorld" <banner-choice>
```

- ### 📥 Download the executables (Non-Go Users)
Precompiled .zip packages are available for each platform in the Releases tab.
Example .zip packages:
- ascii-art-windows.zip
- ascii-art-linux.zip
- ascii-art-macos-intel.zip
- ascii-art-macos-arm64.zip

Each .zip contains a single, ready-to-run binary.
Just extract it and run from your terminal:

```bash
./ascii-art-linux "Hello\nWorld" shadow
```

## 🔭 Future Plans
Here are a few enhancements I plan to add in future updates:

- 🎨 **Color Output**: Add a `--color` flag so users can stylize their ASCII art with terminal color codes (e.g., red, green, cyan, etc.)
- 🔁 **Reverse Mode**: Option to reverse the input text before rendering it in ASCII format
- 💾 **Output to File**: Allow users to save the ASCII art output to a file of their choice using an `--output` or `-o` flag
- 📐 **Text Alignment**: Add flags for aligning text output (`--left`, `--center`, `--right`) for better formatting control
- 🛠 **CLI flag support** in builder (e.g., --os linux, --zip, --clean)
- 📦 **Auto-zipping** in the build step for smoother releases
- 🤖 **Optional GitHub/Gitea CI integration** to automate building and releasing
